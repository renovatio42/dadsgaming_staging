## Chemical Winter ##

I'm an avid gamer and try to play most new releases on release day (doesn't always happen). Other news about me, I am currently in the middle of a move down the street, about to have a little girl named Baylee, and will be streaming frequently.

I love to laugh(alot if possible) Cool tech toys & gadgets, long walks on the beach and the most important thing in life- the nectar from those sweet, sweet beans- Coffee beans that is. Gotta have 'em! ****Thanks for joining the ride with us.**** Shoot, excuse me, and I love my family- alot.(ssheese I almost forget to say that!)

I'm an admitted Pop-Culture junkie that feeds on nostalgia. If I could only read one book ever it would be Ready Player One. When my kids starting asking me to play Joust instead of Skylanders I knew I taught them well.

Breakfast I can pass on, but coffee I won't EVER. I'm a bit a coffee and craft beer snob, my liquid joys. I also enjoy high-tech and low-tech things.
