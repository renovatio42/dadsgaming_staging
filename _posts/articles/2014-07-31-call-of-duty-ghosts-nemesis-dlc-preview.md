Get the first look at Nemesis, the fourth and final DLC Pack for Call of Duty: Ghosts. Nemesis includes four Multiplayer maps: Goldrush, Subzero, Dynasty, and Showtime, a reimagined version of the fan-favorite Shipment from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.

The four-part Extinction saga concludes with Episode 4: Exodus. Explore the biggest Extinction level yet and take on nearly every Cryptid species from previous episodes. You will also contend with the Ancestors - a powerful new enemy with mind control and psionic attacks.

Nemesis arrives first on Xbox LIVE on August 5th, with other platforms to follow.
