##Waiting to Unleash the Kraken##

Well it looks like you'll have to wait till February 10th 2015 to unleash the Kraken along with all the other monsters in Evolve. The news comes according to a financial statement from 2K that the Turtle Rock Studios developed game would be pushed back till early first quarter of 2015.

I have to say that I was looking forward to Evolve the most out of all the releases this fall. All the footage of gameplay looks amazing and you get to kick the crap out of your friends or strangers as a cool monster. If waiting four months means a better game than take your time guys, I'll see you in February.
