  about_blurb: "Breakfast I can pass on, but coffee I won't EVER. I'm a bit a coffee and craft beer snob, my liquid joys. I also enjoy high-tech and low-tech things."

  about_blurb: "I'm an avid gamer and try to play most new releases on release day (doesn't always happen). Other news about me, I am currently in the middle of a move down the street, about to have a little girl named Baylee, and will be streaming frequently."

  about_blurb: "I'm an admitted Pop-Culture junkie that feeds on nostalgia. If I could only read one book ever it would be Ready Player One. When my kids starting asking me to play Joust instead of Skylanders I knew I taught them well. "
